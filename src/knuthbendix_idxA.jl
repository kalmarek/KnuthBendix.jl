## KBS using index automata for rewriting

"""
    KBIndex <: KBS2Alg <: CompletionAlgorithm
The Knuth-Bendix completion algorithm that (if successful) yields the reduced,
confluent rewriting system generated by rules of `rws`.

`KBIndex` uses index automaton to perform rewrites, and delays
the incorporation of newly found rules by maintaining a stack of
them of size controlled by `reduce_delay` of the `Settings` passed along to
`knuthbendix` call.

Additionally confluence checks by backtrack search on the index automaton
are performed after periods when no new rules were discovered.
