    knuthbendix(rws::AbstractRewritingSystem)
    knuthbendix(method::CompletionAlgorithm, rws::AbstractRewritingSystem[, settings:Settings()])
Perform Knuth-Bendix completion on rewriting system `rws` using algorithm
defined by `method`.

!!! warn
    Rewriting systems returned by the completion algorithm may not be confluent.
    Usually this happens when
     * number of rules stored in `rws` exceeds the one permitted in `settings`,
     * the completion process is manually interrupted,
     * or when the `settings` allow the algorithm to skip the processing of
       certain critical pairs.
    You should always assume that the rewriting system is **not** confluent,
    unless [`isconfluent`](@ref) returns `true`.

Unless manually interrupted the returned rewriting system will be reduced.

By default `method = KBIndex()` with its default `settings` are used.
