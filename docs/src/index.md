# Knuth-Bendix completion focused on groups and monoids

This package implements the Knuth-Bendix completion for groups and monoids
given by a finite presentation. It's neither serious, nor performant
implementation compared to other implementations out-there, namely
[`kbmag`](@ref "Knuth-Bendix on Monoids and Automatic Groups (`kbmag`)") by
Derek Holt, or
[`maf`](@ref "Monoid Automata Factory (`maf`)") by Allun Williams.
It was written more for the purpose of learning the fascinating topic of
computation with finitely presented groups.
Nonetheless the implementation is usable, clean and hopefully fun to experiment
with.
